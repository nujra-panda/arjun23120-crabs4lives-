The code requires the dataset to be in two different text files in the same directory as the code. Both the text files should be named as follows :
1) latitude.txt 2) longitude.txt.

Now, inside of the code the correct file directories for the text files should be replaced in ORDER TO RUN THE CODE CORRECTLY ON YOUR PC.

#IMPORTANT - the filepath for the two dataset files should be correctly replaced in the lines 16 and 19 of the code in order for the code to correctly run on your device.


THE FILES OF THE DATASET DOWNLOADED OFF THE INTERNET ARE UPLOADED ON GITHUB AS WELL.

NOTE : we are using k(which is the number of (close to) efficient lines we need to output as 3. Please change the number of possible solutions you want in the line 77 of the code.
Please make sure k>=2
The code might take a few mintutes to run completely to give the final answer and the plot.
